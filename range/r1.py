# for i in range(5): **note: range starts form 0
#     print(i)

# if we want to print the range as our own we can give the range by the following 


for i in range (2, 100): # This describe the range from starting point to the end
    print(i) 

print("---------------------------------------")
# to add the range in (start, end, and step) -> the difference between the number are as follow

for u in range (2, 10, 2):
    print(u)
